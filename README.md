# SowPod_Helper_Console
A console helper to make get better (cheating) at scrabble and other word games easier

This was a very simple project to utilize the European Sowpod Dictionary.

There are currently 2 methods with the console application, validation of words and searching for valid words
- The reasoning for this being the upswing in playing scrabble and associated word games.
- The scrabble html service is good, however it is slow and I preferred having a local application to speed up the process.
